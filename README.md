We are working on IOT based water Management System, which also Monitors the quality of the water.Water Management System is totally based on IOT System and it is a self automated system that prevents the overflow of the water ,when the tank or any large storage reservoir is filled completely. This device also alerts the user when the water storage is full and thus it gets automatically turned off the water pump with the relay module. This actually helps to save wastage of precious resources like water and electricity, and give the recent updates on water usage in the societies.

We have Worked on both Hardware and Software of this Project and we are on the way to introduce the power of AI to this System. We have uploaded all the codes that we have designed for this project.
